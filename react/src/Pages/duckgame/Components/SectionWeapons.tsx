        challenge: 'Create a system that allows for easy addition of new weapon types and shooting strategies without affecting existing functionality.',
        solution: 'The IActionableItem interface is implemented and the Strategy pattern (ShootingStrategy) is used to encapsulate specific shooting behaviors. This allows the integration of new weapon types without modifying existing classes.'

        title: 'Management of Unique Bullet Behaviors',
        challenge: 'Ensure that each bullet type (normal, explosive, bouncy, and special) has unique properties and effects while maintaining organized code.',
        solution: 'A class hierarchy for bullets is defined, with a base Bullet class and specific subclasses that encapsulate unique behaviors. This simplifies code management and reuse.'

    {
        title: 'Centralized Weapon Creation',
        challenge: 'Avoid logic duplication when creating weapons with specific characteristics.',
        solution: 'The WeaponFactory class was designed to be responsible for constructing weapons and assigning the corresponding shooting strategy. This centralizes the logic and makes it easier to create new weapons.'

        title: 'Simulation of Sustained Actions (Continuous Shooting)',
        challenge: 'Manage the weapon state to support actions like automatic, semi-automatic or sustained shooting.',
        solution: 'A continuous update method was implemented in IActionableItem, which evaluates the weaponâ€™s state and adjusts its behavior dynamically based on its type.'

    "Special: Moves like the explosive bullet, but this one pushes the player it touches. It does not disappear until a player collides with it.",
    "Elastic: Bounces when colliding with platforms and deals damage when hitting players, disappearing after a certain number of bounces."
